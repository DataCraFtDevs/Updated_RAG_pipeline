Specifically, it highlights that entrepreneurial education modules designed to teach entrepreneurship to students were not well valued or managed by students, leading to poor engagement. However, other activities such as entrepreneurship development centers, hackathons, and extracurricular programs contributed to the development of entrepreneurial skills among students. The document also emphasizes the importance of hands-on research projects, business competitions, and final year projects in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, it notes that involvement of industrial partners and lecturers' commitments to teaching entrepreneurial skills have led to the acquisition of necessary skills by students. Overall, while there are challenges in translating these practices beyond graduation, the document suggests that Nigerian universities are making progress in developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills among their students.","Summarize this document using 150 words, highlight only important concepts","education, research"
/Users/admin/Documents/pdf_file_blobs/-files-64616221-Post_Print.pdf,"The document discusses the relationship between corporate governance and cost of equity (COE). The study aims to examine the moderating effect of ownership concentration levels on this relationship. A panel regression model is used to analyze the data, with the variables including COE, Corporate Governance Index (CGI), firm size (SIZE), leverage (LEVERAGE), and profitability (ROA).

The authors specify two models: a baseline model that examines the relationship between CGI and COE, and a main estimation model that includes the moderating effect of ownership concentration. The study uses a panel regression approach with fixed effects to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.

The key findings are:

* Corporate governance has a negative impact on COE
* Ownership concentration levels moderate this relationship
* The interaction between CGI and ownership concentration is significant

Overall, the study provides insights into how corporate governance and ownership structure affect the cost of equity.","Summarize this document using 150 words, highlight only important concepts","finance, economics"

The authors use data from the Japanese R&D Survey, World Bank database, and Labour Force Survey of Japan to analyze the impact of R&D on employment. They find that domestic investments play a vital role in boosting employment, particularly in the services and agricultural sectors. Additionally, they show that population growth is associated with an increase in the demand for labor across all models.

The authors also examine the gender gap in innovation-driven employment. They find that male-driven innovation has a stronger effect on employment than female-driven innovation in high-routine intensity tasks, suggesting the presence of gender differences.

Finally, the document highlights the importance of considering macroeconomic and supply-side determinants when analyzing the demand for labor. The authors conclude that technological advancements have a more significant impact on employment growth than trade in routine tasks.","Summarize this document using 150 words, highlight only important concepts","economics, research"
